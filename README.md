Server monitoring via Telegram (C#)

To implement this program in C#, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Install the package on your computer `.NET Framework` version is not lower than 4.0, if it is not already installed.
2. Create a new project in `Visual Studio`.
3. Add the `server.cs` file to the project
4. In the Main method: add the `TOKEN` - the bot token and `CHAT_ID` - the ID of the chat to which messages will be sent.
5. Run the program and check that it is working correctly. To send a command to the server, you need to enter it in a chat with a bot in Telegram. Two commands are available: `/restart` to restart the server and `/shutdown` to shut down the server.
